Implementation of a Trie/Prefix Tree in C++.
There are two versions, one is array based while the other is hashtable based in storage of children nodes implemented as a learning exercise to better understand the data structure.

Possible Future Optimizations:
Merge child nodes with their parent if the they are the only child (parent's child count is 1) bottom up and lazily expand a merged parent on insertion.
Try to match prefixes using radix/overlapping bits to speed up comparison/search.
