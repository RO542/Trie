A basic trie implementation in C++ written with the goal of understanding the data structure better.

Possible Future Optimizations:
Store child nodes inside a hashtable since most children arrays are sparse.
Merge child nodes with their parent if the they are the only child (parent's child count is 1) bottom up and lazily expand a merged parent on insertion.
Try to match prefixes using radix/overlapping bits to speed up comparison/search.
